## ✨ Features

- Modern, minimal design with a liquid-glass aesthetic
- Fully responsive and mobile-friendly layout
- Project showcase with detailed modals, tags, and visuals
- Real-world projects spanning **industry, product, data, and client work**
- Optimized for performance and accessibility
- Smooth interactions and transitions
- Clean, maintainable, component-driven architecture

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Frontend: Gatsby / React / Tailwind CSS
- Deployment: Netlify

---

## ⚡ Why Gatsby?

Gatsby was chosen for this portfolio to prioritize **performance and reliability** while keeping the codebase simple and maintainable.

- **Static-first rendering** for fast load times and strong Lighthouse scores
- **SEO-friendly output** ideal for a public-facing personal site
- **Simple deployment on Netlify** with predictable builds and caching
- **Flexible architecture** that allows page content to be composed from reusable section components rather than route-based pages

For a single-scroll portfolio focused on polish and performance, Gatsby provides an excellent balance between developer experience and production quality.

## 📂 Project Structure

Page content is composed from section components rather than route-based pages, reflecting the site’s single-scroll layout.
